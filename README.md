## What is Jupyter notebook

A Jupyter Notebook is a web-based application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebooks are organized into cells, which can contain code, markdown, or raw text. You can execute code cells to see the output, and modify the code to experiment with different parameters or algorithms.
